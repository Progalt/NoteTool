# NoteTool (Working Title) 

I think a bit of backstory is needed. Currently I'm studying Computer Science at University. Personally I found it hard to take notes for my first year.
I was constantly trying to methods or software to take notes. So over the summer between my first and second year I decided in classic programmer fashion. 
***To Just Make my Own!!*** -> Note taking tool that is. 

I chose C++ for the project because I like C++, for some reason. 


### Supported Platforms

Currently Only windows is the supported platform. But this is easy to fix. The only platform dependant code I haven't ported is the code to get the documents folder and the 
appdata folder. 

### Dependancies

- Freetype
- SDL2 
- stb single header libraries
- tinyfiledialogs (This is already embedded) 
- GLAD (For OpenGL) 
- nlohmann JSON
